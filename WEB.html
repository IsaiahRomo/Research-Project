        <h2>Brief Description</h2>
        <p>
            Software Licensing is a document that provides the use of software to a certain extent while providing guidelines to the user on what they can do. 
            It also allows the user to have the right to own one or more copies of it without violating copyrights. 
            Some software licenses that are free allow to use of the software to no extent other that are paid softwares have restrictions and guidelines that you must follow.
        
        </p>
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
            Software Licensing allows people to own software that companies make without breaking any copyrights of owning it as long as you follow the guidelines.
            This allows companies to make money and provide a software that is reliable and still up to date. 
            Otherwise people wouldn’t be able to get certain software without getting copyright.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            In the 1900’s software license was open to everyone during this time there wasn’t really any agreement and actually license and guidelines.
            People just sold their software and just hoped that it wasn’t copied, it wasn’t a problem since they were audio tapes or hard copies of it.
            As time passed, people started to make unique design on disk so it's hard to copy then came machines that had the software but could only be accessed through some identification like some today.
            More Flexible methods were made as license information was plugged in the machine itself and had to be detected by the software until you can use it.
            Then computers came more connected to the network which lead to online software where they were contracted to a user alone on a server.
            Digital connection came and now companies had online activation so that they can keep a check on user to make sure the software is real and not a fake.

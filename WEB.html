        <p>
            Software Licensing allows people to own software that companies make without breaking any copyrights of owning it as long as you follow the guidelines.
            This allows companies to make money and provide a software that is reliable and still up to date. 
            Otherwise people wouldnâ€™t be able to get certain software without getting copyright.

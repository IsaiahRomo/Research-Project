        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            In the 1900’s software license was open to everyone during this time there wasn’t really any agreement and actually license and guidelines.
            People just sold their software and just hoped that it wasn’t copied, it wasn’t a problem since they were audio tapes or hard copies of it.
            As time passed, people started to make unique design on disk so it's hard to copy then came machines that had the software but could only be accessed through some identification like some today.
            More Flexible methods were made as license information was plugged in the machine itself and had to be detected by the software until you can use it.
            Then computers came more connected to the network which lead to online software where they were contracted to a user alone on a server.
            Digital connection came and now companies had online activation so that they can keep a check on user to make sure the software is real and not a fake.
